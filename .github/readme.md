# 🏭 Qwen3 Voice Factory (RTX 50 Series Optimized)

A local, portable GUI for [Qwen3-TTS](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice).
Specially optimized for **NVIDIA RTX 50 Series** (CUDA 12.8 / PyTorch Nightly), but also runs on previous generations (3090/4090).

> **🎯 Perfect for anyone who wants to test these models quickly without dealing with complex node graphs (ComfyUI).**
